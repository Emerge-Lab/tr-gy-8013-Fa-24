# setup procedure
We use uv to manage our virtual environment. To install uv, please go to the following [link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and follow the installation instructions.

Then, when that is done, you can create a virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
uv run tr_gy_8013_fa_24/setup.py
```

# running the examples
Most of the homeworks and lectures are written in jupyter. To run the jupyter notebooks, you can run the following command:
```bash
uv run jupyter notebook
```
You can also, if you want, activate the virtual environment using
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
